Arete: An OCPP Application
Unlike other OCPP applications available on GitHub, Arete is fully functional and actively maintained. I will provide comprehensive documentation and additional information soon.

I welcome collaboration and encourage you to ask any questions you may have. Currently, I am focusing on the backend development, and I will share instructions on how to run the application later this week.

Thank you, and have a great day! ❤️
